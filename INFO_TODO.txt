Show a regular round clock, which when entering a rest preiod, will highlight the time left until the next set


be able to set up what kind of workout one wants, in my case I mostly want to be able to set:
how many circuits in a total run
how many different exercises in a circuit (for me 3)
-and then set what each exercise is
how many sets per circuit (dependant on the exercise)
how many reps per set (will be the same reps for all sets, could add customisation later)


Need an activity or page for setting up a workout

Need an activity or page for selecting any existing workouts or to choiose to create one
Have a play button to start a workout outright

Need an activity for during workout, which includes the clock, a button to end a set when done, a button to end a rest early, a button to pause everything, a button to end entire workout. Normally the timer will finish the rest and be in 'set' mode waiting for the user
